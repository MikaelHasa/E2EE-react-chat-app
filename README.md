Simple E2EE Chat Demo

A basic real-time chat application built to explore End-to-End Encryption (E2EE).

This project started as a tiny demo for simple messaging, but things got a little "interesting" once I decided to bake in encryption. The codebase is a bit of a "work in progress" because E2EE wasn't in the original blueprint, but it's a functional proof of concept!
